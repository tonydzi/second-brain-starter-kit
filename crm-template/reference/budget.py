r"""budget.py — per-account daily send cap + audit log, safe under concurrency.

Reference extract, trimmed to the contract `safe_send.py` depends on. The live
version additionally shards the log per machine (so several machines can append
without ever writing the same file) — that invariant is documented in
https://github.com/tonydzi/claude-consensus (docs/BUS.md §3),
and is deliberately left out here to keep this file readable.

Why a budget module at all, separate from the sender:
  the number "how many messages may this account send today" is the single most
  important safety dial in an outbound agent, and a human must be able to find it,
  read it, and change it without understanding async code. So it lives alone, it
  is plain SQLite, and it is testable with no network in the room.

RESERVE-THEN-SEND, not check-then-send
--------------------------------------
The obvious design is `if can_send(): send()`. It is wrong twice, and both were
found by an external reviewer rather than by us:

  1. RACE. Two processes ask `can_send()` at the same moment, both see room under
     the cap, both send. With a cap of 1 you get 2 messages out. Any "check, then
     act" against shared state has this hole.
  2. CRASH WINDOW. The platform accepts the message and the process dies before
     the send is recorded. The message is out in the world but the budget never
     learned about it, so a retry sends it again — to a real human.

Both are fixed by the same move: **take the slot BEFORE dispatching**, inside one
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, and confirm it afterwards.

  tok = reserve(acc, lead_slug, kind)   # atomic: counts and inserts 'pending'
  if tok is None: ...                   # cap reached — do not send
  <dispatch>
  confirm(tok, preview)                 # 'pending' -> 'sent'

A `pending` row still counts against the cap. So a crash between reserve and
confirm loses one slot for the day and sends nothing twice. That is the correct
way to fail: an outbound agent should under-send on ambiguity, never over-send.
`release(tok)` exists only for the case where dispatch provably did NOT happen
(e.g. the platform rejected the message before delivery).
