# PUBLISHED SAMPLE - the paths and identifiers below are placeholders, not live
# values. This file runs a real system on the author's machines. Before it runs
# on yours, replace:
#   %VAULT%        your Obsidian vault root
#   %IMPORTS%      wherever you keep these engines' data
#   %USERPROFILE%  your home directory
#   %WORKDIR%      your working folder
# Chat ids, handles, phone numbers and e-mail addresses were swapped for fakes of
# the same shape, so the code still reads and parses - but it talks to nothing
# until you point it at your own accounts.
# Passport (what it does / what breaks / how to fix): see engines/README.md.
