"""FAAA Phase 2 — lead identity resolution (deterministic dedup).

Union-find over call summaries:
  - share a non-team lead @handle  -> same lead (STRONG, exact id)
  - share full normalized lead name -> same lead (MEDIUM)
Single-token common names that collide a lot are flagged review_split.

Output: faaa-leads.json  (lead_id -> aggregate)
