#   %IMPORTS%      wherever you keep these engines' data
#   %USERPROFILE%  your home directory
#   %WORKDIR%      your working folder
# Chat ids, handles, phone numbers and e-mail addresses were swapped for fakes of
# the same shape, so the code still reads and parses - but it talks to nothing

"""
Vault-wide orphan scanner.

Per [[no-orphan-notes-rule]]: every live-vault .md must have >=1 incoming wikilink
from another file. This script builds a reverse index of [[targets]] and writes
a report of files with 0 incoming links.

EXCLUDED folders (per the rule): _originals, _drafts, _imports
EXCLUDED files: index/MOC files, daily-note hubs (auto-list pages), .obsidian/*

Output:
- %IMPORTS%\orphan-scan\orphans.csv         (all orphans)
- %IMPORTS%\orphan-scan\orphans-by-folder.csv (counts per folder)
- %IMPORTS%\orphan-scan\orphans.html         (visual dashboard)
- %IMPORTS%\orphan-scan\scan-summary.txt     (counters)

Token-economy: deterministic (0 LLM tokens). Per [[vault-data-architecture]].
