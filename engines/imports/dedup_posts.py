#   %IMPORTS%      wherever you keep these engines' data
#   %USERPROFILE%  your home directory
#   %WORKDIR%      your working folder
# Chat ids, handles, phone numbers and e-mail addresses were swapped for fakes of
# the same shape, so the code still reads and parses - but it talks to nothing

"""Systematic exact-duplicate detection across Telegram post files.
- body = text between frontmatter and '## See Also', whitespace-normalized
- exact dups (same hash) -> keep earliest by filename, delete rest, record remap
- near dups (same normalized first 300 chars, different hash) -> REPORT only
Writes dedup_report.json. Does NOT delete unless APPLY=1 env is set.
