# on yours, replace:
#   %VAULT%        your Obsidian vault root
#   %IMPORTS%      wherever you keep these engines' data
#   %USERPROFILE%  your home directory
#   %WORKDIR%      your working folder
# Chat ids, handles, phone numbers and e-mail addresses were swapped for fakes of
# the same shape, so the code still reads and parses - but it talks to nothing
# until you point it at your own accounts.

"""_paths.py -- ONE place _imports ENGINE scripts resolve machine-specific roots.

Reads ~/.claude/machine.env (per-machine; schema in
~/.claude/_config-backup/machine.env.template) with HP17 fallbacks, so a MISSING or
partial machine.env NEVER breaks a script. Mirrors hooks/_machine_paths.py (same
machine.env FILE = single source of truth) for the _imports side, since _imports is
NOT on the hooks dir's import path.

Usage (root-level engine scripts):
    try:
        from _paths import VAULT
    except Exception:
        VAULT = r"%VAULT%"   # HP17 fallback

Decision: decision-unified-multi-machine-platform (Phase 3b). AK-47: tiny, stdlib,
fallbacks everywhere. _imports is NOT synced (each machine its own copy) -> machine.env
is what makes a copied engine script land on the right paths on a Mac/other-user box.
One-time import scripts are FROZEN historical artifacts (won't run cross-OS) -> not refactored.
