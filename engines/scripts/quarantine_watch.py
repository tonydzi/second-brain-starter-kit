r"""quarantine_watch.py -- watchdog: a NEW held package -> ping Anton at 02 POLICE.

Per alert-ownership-routing: a quarantined package is a "needs-Anton" event (could be a genuine
delayed delivery, could be an injection attempt) -> it must reach the clean 02-POLICE channel,
not be scrolled past in 03. This is the OWNED endpoint for layer 4.

0 tokens, deterministic. Dedups by id in `_deploy\.quarantine_alerted-<host>.json` so a package
that stays held is announced ONCE, not every run. A released/discarded package drops out of `held`
so it never re-alerts. Posts via the fleet bot (tg_bot_send.post_to 02-POLICE); if no bot token on
this machine the alert degrades to stdout (SessionStart deploy_check still surfaces it).

  python quarantine_watch.py            # ping for any NEW held package, rebuild dashboard
  python quarantine_watch.py --dry      # print what it WOULD ping, no send, no state write

Run as a periodic task (see install note in the quarantine skill). Canon: memory
