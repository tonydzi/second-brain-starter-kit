"""codex_bridge.py -- Phase 1 of the Claude<->Codex two-vendor consensus chat.

WHAT (Decision Memo 2026-07-14, DR26-07-14-HUB-15, variant B "Hybrid Signed Artifact Chat"):
  A THIN engine that produces ONE signed conversational turn from Codex, WITH memory across
  turns. Claude (the live session) orchestrates the round: reads the "04 AI-DUO" Telegram chat
  via MCP, calls this to get Codex's reply, posts it back. This is the SUPERVISED live-session
  path -- NOT an unattended nightly daemon (that would sit in the ChatGPT-subscription ToS gray
  zone + burn the 5h quota; explicitly deferred to Phase 2 per the Memo).

WHY a bridge and not free-form chat:
  All three DR vendors (ChatGPT/Gemini/Grok) agreed: two AIs talking freely is theatre
  (sycophant loops, drift, the documented $47k runaway). Consensus must ride TYPED, SIGNED
  turns; Telegram is the human-visible MIRROR. So Codex is prompted to answer as a structured
  move (PROPOSE / COUNTER / ACCEPT / BLOCK + rationale), and every reply is HMAC-signed with the
  shared fleet secret so a "[Codex]:" line typed by anyone else is just DATA, never a real turn.

MEMORY across turns [DR: established] -- resume is an OPTIMIZATION, not the source of truth:
  Codex supports `codex exec resume <SESSION_ID> <PROMPT>`. First turn = plain `codex exec`, then
  we capture the new session's id (see _new_session_id: the NEW rollout file written by
  `codex_exec`, not the newest-mtime -- resume re-appends to old files and the Codex desktop app
  writes its own, so mtime lies) and store it per-conversation. Later turns resume that id so Codex
  keeps low-level session context cheaply. BUT the canonical context is what the ORCHESTRATOR
  hands in via --context each turn (the relevant recent chat lines), exactly as the DR advised:
  "keep the source of truth in the passed artifacts, use resume only as a performance optimization."
  So Codex answers to the DIALOGUE block it is given; do not rely on hidden session memory to carry
  facts the orchestrator didn't pass. If resume fails, we fall back to a fresh exec, no data lost.

TURN-TAKING / STOP (held by the ORCHESTRATOR, i.e. Claude in-session, not here):
  max 3 rounds, then tie-break or escalate to Anton (QQQ). This engine just emits one turn.

Usage:
  python codex_bridge.py turn --task <conv-id> --context "<recent dialogue text>"
                              [--role propose|counter|verify] [--model M] [--timeout S] [--fresh]
  python codex_bridge.py selftest        # offline sanity (no codex call)

Output (stdout): the signed reply text (body + FLEET-SIG trailer). Exit 0 on success.
Subscription only: Codex uses the ChatGPT-subscription login, never a paid API key.

  Anton (the human) sets goals.
- Answer as ONE short structured move, not an essay. Start your message with exactly one tag:
  PROPOSE / COUNTER / VERIFY / ACCEPT / BLOCK. Then one or two sentences of rationale. If you
  genuinely agree with the current proposal, say ACCEPT and stop -- do NOT invent objections to
  seem useful (no sycophancy, no nitpicking).
- You are an adversarial second pair of eyes: your value is catching what Claude got wrong, not
