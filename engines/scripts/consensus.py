"""consensus.py -- autonomous machine<->machine CONSENSUS engine (Phase 1).

WHY: the machines already MOVE messages reliably (bus_send.py dual-rail), but they could not
NEGOTIATE a decision and converge WITHOUT Anton acting as courier. This adds the missing layer:
a structured propose -> counter -> accept -> commit negotiation with a deterministic tie-break,
an append-only decision log, idempotency over the redundant rails, and a hard human gate for
Tier-2. Synthesis of two Deep-Research reports (#19, #21) + our own canon.

ARCHITECTURE (Anton 2026-06-28):
  * SOURCE OF TRUTH (machine-readable): per-machine single-writer JSONL shards
      <bus>/_decisions/log-<MACHINE>.jsonl   (option A; single-writer => 0 Syncthing conflicts,
      same forever-fix as the read-bookmarks; git 3-way-merges append-only text cleanly).
      Each machine appends ONLY to its own shard; readers MERGE all shards by proposal_id and
      dedup events by event_id (idempotent across duplicate multi-rail delivery).
  * ALWAYS-ON DUAL + human-visible feed + recoverable record: Telegram chat 03. EVERY event is
      emitted through bus_send.py, which dual-sends to BOTH Telegram-03 and [шина] BY
      CONSTRUCTION (single rail is forbidden) -> "TG always on" is structural, not optional, and
      every envelope carries type+id+actor+subject so the negotiation is readable in plain sight
      and the ledger is reconstructable from Telegram alone if a shard is lost.

GOVERNANCE: hub HUB1 = fixed leader (disagree-and-commit tie-break). Tier-2
(money/outbound/irreversible/secrets/config) NEVER auto-commits -> escalates to Anton (QQQ).

Verbs:
  propose "<subject>" [--details '<json>'] [--tier N] [--id <id>] [--reversible]
  respond <id> accept|counter|reject ["text"]
  commit  <id>                      # record the agreed decision-of-record (the AGENT then applies it)
  verify  <id> "<proof>"            # cross-agent epistemic flag: both must verify before 'done'
  escalate <id> "<reason>"          # hand a stuck/risky proposal to Anton
  status  <id>                      # show one proposal's merged state + event timeline
  list    [--open|--all]            # list proposals (default: open ones)
  tick                              # deterministic driver: timeouts, round-cap, tie-break, Tier-2 gate
  pending [--json]                  # 0-LLM detector: open proposals AWAITING MY RESPONSE (judge work-list)
  approve <id> "<proof>"            # record the HUMAN's OK (QQQ: who/where/msg-id) -> unlocks commit for tier-2
