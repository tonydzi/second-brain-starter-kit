description: >
  On-demand pull of fresh calls from Fireflies.ai (auto-recording bot, real speaker names) into
  the Obsidian vault via the official GraphQL API, plus distillation (action items /
  commitments) and reindex. Incremental + idempotent (state keyed by transcript id) — safe to
  re-run. Trigger on "/fireflies-sync", "pull fireflies", "sync call recordings".

OBJECTIVE: Incrementally pull fresh calls from Fireflies into the vault (a note with diarized speaker NAMES + summary + action items), catch the distillation up (alpha/commitments/facts) and make sure it lands in the index.

CONTEXT:
- Transport: the official Fireflies GraphQL API `https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql`. Key: `FIREFLIES_API_KEY` in `secrets\fireflies.env` (SSO account, PRO plan). Autojoin is ON — the bot joins calendar calls by itself (catching standups and corporate calls that a manually-started recorder misses).
- Engine (all the logic lives there, this skill is a thin wrapper): `$IMPORTS_ROOT/fireflies\fireflies_pull.py`. One script does both backfill and increment.
- Home for notes: `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT/04-Projects\fireflies-meetings\` (auto_generated — never edit by hand). Raw JSON (with keys COMPATIBLE with the other call rail, which `call_distill.py` consumes): `$IMPORTS_ROOT/fireflies\raw\`. State: `$IMPORTS_ROOT/fireflies\state.json`. Log: `pull.log`.
- ⚠️ The nightly pull runs on the anchor node: vault notes travel by sync, but the raw JSON does NOT reach the hub → the hub's distiller cannot see fresh Fireflies calls. Running this skill on the hub CLOSES that gap: the local state lags behind the anchor's → the pull drags the missing raw files here (idempotent; notes are rewritten with identical content).
- Distillation: `$IMPORTS_ROOT/granola\call_distill.py` reads BOTH raw directories (granola + fireflies) → `_distilled\` + commitments.jsonl.

STEPS:
1. BACKUP FIRST ([[vault-backup-rule]]): `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/vault_backup.py` BEFORE running anything.
2. Pull: `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/fireflies\fireflies_pull.py` (options: `--dry`, `--limit N`). Counters on stdout: `DONE new=X errors=Y state_total=N`.
3. Distill (if new>0): `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/granola\call_distill.py` — counters `DONE distilled=M commitments=C errors=Z`.
4. Report the list of fresh calls (titles/dates). errors>0 → check the log; usually network or 429 (the script retries by itself).
5. Reindex: the nightly `brain_embed_update.py` picks it up on its own; after a big backfill, run it manually. ⚠️ Until `_distilled` is marked `layer: essence`, distillates do not enter the curated index (a known gap, tracked as task RUSL-1).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Windows cp1252: stdout must stay ASCII-only (the script already complies).
- INCREMENTAL ONLY — never delete `state.json` (it would re-download everything).
- Provenance: origin: mixed, authored_by: hybrid — NOT #anton-original (someone else's speech).
- Tier-2: nothing goes outside; API reads and vault writes only.
- A 401 from the API means the key was revoked: get a new one in the Fireflies dashboard (Integrations → API) and update `secrets\fireflies.env`. ⚠️ CRLF pitfall: a trailing `\r` breaks the Bearer header (the engine already strips it).
- Do NOT re-enable the hub task "Fireflies Nightly Pull" without consensus — it is deliberately Disabled (migrated to the anchor node, see fleet_migration_dashboard.py migrated_markers).

OUTPUT: the pull counters (new) + the distill counters (distilled/commitments) + the period; if empty, "no new calls". Finish with an "In plain words" recap.

RELATION (do not duplicate): the other call rail = skill [[granola-sync]]; the comparison of the two rails + the "where content lands" map = the vault `00-System` note / task RUSL-1; the alpha screen = `/alpha-review`.
