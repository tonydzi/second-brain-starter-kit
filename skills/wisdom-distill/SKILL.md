# /wisdom-distill — the wisdom of the week

> 🧒 When reporting to a non-technical operator, end with an "In plain words" recap in their language.

## Run (deterministic first — 0 tokens)
`python "$IMPORTS_ROOT/wisdom_week_gather.py"` (or `... 14` for a 14-day window) ->
notes marked `origin: anton`/`#anton-original` inside the window (date field, mtime as fallback), excluding
`_originals/_imports/_Dashboards`, capped at 60 x 500 chars -> `$IMPORTS_ROOT/_wisdom_week_digest.md`.
**The LLM reads only the digest, never the corpus.**

## Distill (top model — synthesis, not grunt work)
From the digest, pull 3-5 durable lessons of the week (each must survive a month; "how the owner now thinks/decides").
Format: the lesson in one line in the owner's voice · Source: [[note-a]], [[note-b]] (2+ = stronger) ·
What it changes: which decision it will show up in. Drop transient items, other people's ideas, the self-evident.
Thin week (<3) — say so plainly, do not invent.

## Save (backup-first: vault_backup.py)
Note: $OBSIDIAN_VAULT/03-Insights/insight-weekly-wisdom-YYYY-Www.md
Frontmatter: title, date, type: insight, origin: anton, authored_by: hybrid,
tags: [insight, weekly-wisdom, anton-original], summary. Link the sources
(no-orphan-notes-rule); if beliefs are touched, link the matching belief-* note. NO 🧒 block inside the note.

## Scheduled twin
Cron `wisdom-distill-weekly`: Sunday 23:20 Lisbon (routines-run-at-night). Gatherer ->
distillation (top-model subagent) -> note -> announcement in the fleet log chat (bus_ping.py --post).
The manual twin is this skill. Single source of truth = wisdom_week_gather.py.
