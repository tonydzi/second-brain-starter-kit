# Improve Website AEO/GEO

[![AEO Audit](../assets/aeo-audit-screenshot.jpeg)](https://aeo-audit.sh/)

The web is no longer read only by humans. AI agents — ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews — are now how millions of people discover information. These agents don't browse. They extract, parse, and decide in milliseconds whether your content is worth citing.

**If your site isn't optimized for AI, you're invisible to a growing share of your audience.**

This is an agent skill that audits your website's codebase and makes concrete improvements to boost your AEO (AI Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) scores.

**Check your score at [aeo-audit.sh](https://aeo-audit.sh/)** — then use this skill to improve it.

## Install

Clone the repo, then symlink or copy `improve-aeo-geo/` into either `~/.codex/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`. See the root [README](../README.md) for installation examples.

## Usage

Once installed, invoke the skill by name:

```
/improve-aeo-geo
```

Or reference it in conversation:

> "Use the AEO skill to optimize this site"
> "Run the AEO/GEO audit on my codebase"

The skill will:
1. Detect your framework (Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, SvelteKit, WordPress, Hugo, Jekyll, and more)
2. Audit your code against 16 foundational checks and 6 content quality dimensions
3. Make targeted code changes in priority order
4. Recommend verifying your score at [aeo-audit.sh](https://aeo-audit.sh/)
