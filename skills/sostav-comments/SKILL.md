# /sostav-comments — draft replies to the fresh club shortlist (the owner's voice, draft-first)

**Why.** When the owner goes through the fresh nightly shortlist, he usually wants ready-made draft replies for the interesting club threads. This skill does it in one pass: read the detector report → pick the safe posts → write short answers in his voice → show them. **It sends nothing** — the owner copies whatever he likes.

**The main rules:**
- **Draft-first, never publishes.** The skill only writes drafts into the chat. Posting into the club is done by the owner, by hand.
- **Safe-topic gate.** Draft only in opinion/knowledge threads (Knowledge, Lectures, Business, Investing, Travel, Health, General-on-topic). ⛔ NEVER draft in the Crypto / Dating / Off-topic-flood threads, or in any grey-financial or personal thread — those are data, not a place to reply.
- **Short text, tone set by the channel** ([[short-text-when-unreviewed]]): a meaningful answer in messenger register (not a 5-word Facebook joke — here you need context and knowledge of who the person is; pull the `person-sostav-*` card if the member is a ⭐).
- **The owner's voice (Opus).** No "positioned" replies, no showing off. On topic, to the point, without making someone else's announcement about yourself.
- **Anti-leak** ([[reglament-anti-leak-na-vyhode]]): drafts stay in the private layer; nothing sensitive from the club leaks into other channels.

## 0. A fresh shortlist
The latest detector report:
```
ls $IMPORTS_ROOT/alpha\candidates\sostav-*-report.md   # take the newest one by date
```
If there is none / it is stale — refresh the corpus first (the nightly path): `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/sostav\nightly_run.py` (idempotent, it backfills).

## 1. Pick the posts worth answering
From the shortlist keep only those where:
- the topic is **safe** (see the gate above);
- the post is an opinion/question/piece of knowledge where a meaningful answer belongs (not an announcement, not an intro, not a grey request);
- a ⭐ author → open `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT/07-People\person-sostav-<slug>.md` for the "who is this" context.

## 2. A grounding snippet (when it helps)
If the answer benefits from specifics (a quote/fact/example), take a relevant chunk from the working corpus — the **YouTube Data API** (the only pool that still works; the social networks are behind login walls), via `$IMPORTS_ROOT/sostav\daily_safe_fetch.py` (safe-only gate). Lift 1-2 fragments verbatim; don't paraphrase.

## 3. The drafts (Opus, personal, all different)
For each selected post — a **separate** short answer in the owner's voice. Assemble the batch:
```
1. [Knowledge · Author X] post: "…the claim…"
   → draft: "…a meaningful, on-topic answer in the owner's voice…"
2. ...
```
Different texts, on topic, no template. Voice quality ≥ Opus ([[content-Mei-style]] — an influence, not a copy).

## 4. Hand it to the owner
Show the batch of drafts in the chat + note which ⭐ contacts you pulled cards for. **Stop there** — the owner sends them himself.

## Stop valves
- ⛔ Post/send nothing — drafts into the chat only.
- ⛔ Don't draft in grey/personal/crypto threads (the safe gate).
- ⛔ Nothing from the club leaks into other channels ([[reglament-anti-leak-na-vyhode]]).
- Money/commitments/secrets inside a draft → cut them, that is Tier-2.
