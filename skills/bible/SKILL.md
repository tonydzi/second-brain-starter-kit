# Bible — Anton's behavioral codex (mega-skill)

> 🧒 **When reporting to Anton:** end with a child-simple "Простыми словами" recap in his language (his standing request; reports TO Anton only — never inside vault notes or outbound messages). See memory `eli5-always`.

The Bible is not documentation — it is the **behavioral регламент for every actor that acts as or for Anton**: Anton himself, his living assistants, and silicon agents (LLM/AI). One artifact, many readers. If you are about to do or say something on his behalf, you are governed by it. Canonical logic lives in the vault note `protocol-bible-as-prompt`.

## Who is governed
Anything done "as Anton" or "on Anton's behalf" — you (the agent), his assistants, him.

## Where the rules live (single source of truth = the vault)
Vault root: `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT`. **Never duplicate rules into this skill — copies drift.** Load from:
- **Свод (umbrella):** `concept-bible-platinum`.
- **Domains / indexes:**
  - 📤 Outreach & external leads (priority #1): `_Bible-Outreach-MOC`
  - 🏢 Operations: `_Operations-Bible-MOC` · Trello cards: `_Bible-Trello-Index`
  - 🛒 Purchases: `_Pokupki-Rules`
  - 🙋 Anton's personal layer: `concept-bible-personal`
- **Altitudes (note prefixes):** `insight-*` (principle) → `protocol-*` (playbook) → `reglament-*` (atomic rule) → `decision-*` (precedent).
- **Self-maintenance:** `protocol-bible-self-maintenance`. **Secrets boundary:** `decision-bible-secrets-quarantine`.

## How to load the right slice
Pull the **narrow relevant slice** for the task — not all 10 years.
- By domain: open the matching MOC above.
- By meaning: `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/brain_ask.py "<question>"` (semantic search over the curated layer).
- By keyword: grep `reglament-*` / `protocol-*` under `03-Insights\Operations\` and `05-Resources\Protocols\`.
- Filter by `audience`: load `agent` + `both`; skip `human`-only (needs live judgment).

## Precedence — resolving conflicting rules
1. **Newer beats older on the same topic** (Anton's law) — by `date_established`; the loser becomes `superseded`.
2. **Anton's explicit rules are protected** — to override an `origin: anton` / `authored_by: human` rule, the new one must also be Anton's or carry `supersedes:`. Team/agent don't override Anton by date alone.
3. **Specific beats general** (carve-outs).
4. **Priority flag** `must` > `should` > `may`.
5. Letter-vs-spirit clash (reglament vs insight) → escalate to Anton to rewrite the reglament.

## consult → act → write-back
1. **Consult** the slice before acting.
2. **Act** by the rules. Consequential/irreversible (money, outbound to external people, commitments, access) → **Tier-2: ask Anton** (`operating-agreement`). Outbound lead messages = draft→approve, never autonomous.
3. **Gap → escalate** to Anton; his answer becomes a new `reglament-*` (verbatim, with `audience`). "Error/gap → write the rule immediately."

## Secrets quarantine
Because the Bible is now a prompt, never load or emit secrets (passwords, accesses, financial figures, "grey" techniques). They live outside the loadable Bible. See `decision-bible-secrets-quarantine`.

## Relation to other skills
`telegram-assistant` and `telegram-lead-outreach` are channel playbooks **under this contract** — same precedence, same write-back, same secrets boundary. When they act on Anton's behalf, this skill's rules apply.

## How to write a rule (dual-reader)
Verbatim from Anton · imperative `WHEN → DO` · self-contained + example · frontmatter (`type`, altitude, `audience`, `theme`, `origin`, `authored_by`, `date_established`, `status`, `confidence`, plus `supersedes` / `superseded_by` on replacement). Full standard: vault note `protocol-bible-as-prompt`. **Step-by-step playbook with examples (even for a weak LLM): vault note `protocol-bible-rule-authoring`.**
