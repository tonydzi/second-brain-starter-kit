# /arch — System Architect (the map and health of the whole system)

One place that knows what the system is made of, what is healthy, what fell over — and tests it. Deterministic, 0 tokens, READ-ONLY. This is **RECALL for the infrastructure layer**: look BEFORE changing shared infrastructure, rescan AFTER.

**Engine:** `$IMPORTS_ROOT/arch/` (git-backed in `_imports`). The source of truth is `system.db` (built by the nightly scan at 05:45). Dashboard `_Dashboards\System-Health.html`, MOC `00-System\_System-MOC.md`, auto-inventory `00-System\System-Automations.md` (replaces the manual [[automation-inventory]]).

## Commands

```bash
# status (default) — health summary + score
python "$IMPORTS_ROOT/arch/arch_status.py"

# only what is broken / red
python "$IMPORTS_ROOT/arch/arch_status.py" broken

# dead code — scripts wired to nothing
python "$IMPORTS_ROOT/arch/arch_status.py" dead
```

- **`/arch`** → `arch_status.py` (status).
- **`/arch broken`** → `arch_status.py broken`.
- **`/arch dead`** → `arch_status.py dead`.
- **`/arch scan`** (force a fresh scan, AFTER an infrastructure change) → rebuild the catalog:
  ```bash
  cd /d $IMPORTS_ROOT/arch
  python sys_scan.py && python sys_coverage.py && python build_system_docs.py && python build_arch_map.py && python sys_check.py
  ```
  (That is the `run_architect.cmd` pipeline minus the final `vault_backup.py`. The full nightly run = `run_architect.cmd`, scheduled task "System Architect Nightly" at 05:45.)

## When to use it (STANDING — an always-loaded rule)
- **BEFORE** adding/removing/changing shared infrastructure (a scheduled task, an `_imports` script, an MCP, a DB, a hook, a skill, a pipeline) → `/arch` / `/arch broken`: what exists and what depends on it — will I break a neighbour?
- **AFTER** the change → `/arch scan`, so the map does not fall behind reality.
- **RED** → deal with the red first; `result!=0` on a task does not always mean "broken" (a benign lock collision happens — check the source). Never delete an `active`/`critical` asset before understanding its dependencies.

## Pitfalls (from memory)
- A coverage metric must MEASURE the artifact, not hardcode a verdict (the false backup-line alarm, 2026-06-22).
- `RED.flag` is written only on critical/daily failures (SRE style: alert on the symptom). The phase-5 routine `system-architect-red-alert` (06:21) pings Telegram Saved Messages when red and stays silent when green.

## Canon
Memory [[system-architect]] · decision `decision-architect-system-platform` · the Bible rule "check the map before changing the system" (for human assistants and LLMs alike). Related: [[verify-existing-before-proposing]], [[automation-inventory]], [[vault-data-architecture]].
