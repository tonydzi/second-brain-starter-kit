# /skill-gap — what skill should we build next?

> 🧒 When reporting to Anton end with a child-simple "Простыми словами" recap. (memory `eli5-always`)

Finds the gap between what Anton DOES (recurring manual work across sessions) and what he HAS (installed skills), and proposes the highest value × frequency new skills. Read-only; proposes, never auto-builds. Mirror of [[evaluate-recurring-into-routine]] (that catches one task → routine; this scans the whole fleet of sessions → skill gaps).

## Method (token-cheap — cheap tools first, [[vault-data-architecture]])
1. **The week's agenda (≈0 tokens):** `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__list_sessions` (limit ~60) — session TITLES are the agenda; cluster them by theme. Don't read every transcript; use titles + memory. (Full-text `search_session_transcripts` needs Anton's approval — only if a cluster is ambiguous.) ⚠️ This only sees THIS machine's sessions; with the cross-machine relay live ([[machine-migration]], skill `inbox`) a pattern from another computer is invisible here — note the current-machine label and don't assume the gap is global.
2. **What's already built:** the installed skills (the Skill tool list) + on-disk `$USERPROFILE/.claude/skills/*\SKILL.md`. Also note scheduled routines that have NO manual skill twin.
3. **Cross-map:** for each session cluster, is there a skill that covers it? RECALL memory ([[machine-migration]], [[n8n-stack]], [[notebooklm-integration]], etc.) so you don't propose something a neighboring session already built — this is the #1 trap (a parallel session, INCLUDING one on another machine, may have shipped it; check `/inbox` / the relay).
4. **Rank gaps by value × repeat:** how many sessions touched it? does it hurt now? is the infra already there (→ thin wrapper, cheap to build)? Flag ⚠️ УСЛОЖНЕНИЕ for anything heavy ([[ak47-simplicity]]).

## Output
- A ranked table: gap · откуда видно (which sessions) · оценка (HIGH/MED/LOW) · есть ли уже инфра.
- Top 2-3 as **ДО→ПОСЛЕ on real data** ([[show-before-after]]).
- Refresh the dashboard: `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT/_Dashboards/Skill-Gap-Audit.html` (Anton works by eye, [[prefer-visual-dashboards]]).
- Then 🧒 recap. End by asking which to build (his "+" = go).

## Daily routine
Scheduled twin `skill-gap-daily` runs this read-only and updates the dashboard + drops a one-line note if a NEW gap appeared since yesterday (don't nag if nothing changed). Grunt drafting → Sonnet; the judgment/ranking → keep on the session model ([[model-routing-sonnet-grunt]]).
