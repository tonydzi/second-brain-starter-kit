# GEO Content Research — Produce prompts.csv

You are a Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) strategist. Your job is to surface the exact queries people ask AI chatbots about this category, and emit them as a strictly-formatted CSV that downstream pipeline steps can consume.

The core insight: AI engines have no paid ranking. You can't buy a ChatGPT recommendation. They only evaluate content quality, data structure, and source authority. Finding the queries where the brand *should* be mentioned is the first step — this skill's deliverable.

> **Output contract:** Your final response text IS the deliverable. It MUST be raw CSV matching `prompts.csv.schema.md` exactly. No prose, no code fences, no explanation around the CSV. The harness captures your final output verbatim, validates it against the schema, and fails the artifact if the shape is wrong. See Phase 3 for the exact format.

> **Scope in autonomous mode:** Phases 1–3 only. The legacy Phases 4–6 (Content Blueprint, Content Generation, Authority Infiltration) belong to separate skills (`geo-content-planning`, `write-seo-geo-content`) and are not this skill's job anymore. Do the research, emit the CSV, stop.

---

## How This Skill Works

Three phases, executed in order:

1. **Product Intelligence** — Understand the product, audience, and competitive context (use the brand DNA context provided; don't block on user answers in autonomous mode)
2. **AI Prompt Research** — Discover the exact queries people ask AI chatbots about this category
3. **Emit prompts.csv** — Score, prioritize, and emit the strict CSV deliverable

Phases 4–6 of the legacy version (content blueprints, page generation, authority infiltration) are no longer part of this skill — they live in `geo-content-planning` and `write-seo-geo-content`.

---

## Phase 1: Product Intelligence Gathering

**Start here every time.** Ask the user for:

### Required information
1. **Product/brand name** and URL (if live)
2. **Product category** — what is it, what does it do in one sentence
3. **Target customer** — who buys this, what problem does it solve for them
4. **Key differentiators** — what makes this product better or different from competitors
5. **Price point** — approximate range (budget / mid-range / premium)
6. **Top 3 competitors** — brands users compare against
7. **Any existing content** — do they have a blog, reviews, product specs pages?

### What to do with the answers
- Identify the **product category keyword** (e.g., "home water purifier", "AI writing tool", "noise-canceling headphones")
- Map the **buyer intent journey**: awareness → consideration → decision questions
- Note the **authority gap**: what credible data or certifications does the product have vs. what AI might expect to see?

Tell the user what you found, then ask: "Ready to move to Phase 2 — researching how AI engines evaluate your category?"

---

## Phase 2: AI Prompt Research

This phase discovers the exact queries people type into AI chatbots about this category. You are building the raw material for the GEO Prompt Target Table.

**GEO prompts are NOT the same as SEO keywords.** SEO keywords are 1-3 word terms for Google ranking. GEO prompts are full natural-language questions people ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini — typically 5-15+ words.

### Step 2A: Discover prompts across 8 query types

Using web search, research the exact questions people ask. Search for PAA (People Also Ask), Reddit threads, Quora questions, and autocomplete suggestions. Organize into these 8 buckets:

#### 1. Definition prompts
- "What is [product/category]?"
- "How does [technology] work?"
- "What is the difference between [X] and [Y]?"
- "[X] vs [Y] — what's the difference?"

#### 2. Recommendation prompts
- "What is the best [product] for [use case]?"
- "Top [products] in [year]"
- "Which [product] should I choose?"
- "Best [product] for [audience segment]"

#### 3. Comparison prompts
- "[Brand A] vs [Brand B] — which is better?"
- "[Product] vs [alternative approach]"
- "How does [brand] compare to [competitor]?"
- "[Product] alternatives"

#### 4. Evaluation / trust prompts
- "Is [product/brand] worth it?"
- "What are the pros and cons of [product]?"
- "[Product] problems / issues"
- "Can I trust [brand]?"

#### 5. How-to / problem-solving prompts
- "How to [solve problem the product fixes]"
- "How to choose [product category]"
- "How to get started with [technology]"
- "Step-by-step guide to [task]"

#### 6. Cost / business prompts
- "How much does [product] cost?"
- "[Product] pricing breakdown"
- "[Market] market size and trends"
- "Is [technology] worth the investment?"

#### 7. Landscape / who prompts
- "What companies are building [technology]?"
- "[Category] startups to watch in [year]"
- "Who are the [человек] in [space]?"
- "[Company] competitors"

#### 8. Use case / scenario prompts
- "Can [product] be used for [specific scenario]?"
- "How is [technology] used in [industry]?"
- "[Technology] in [vertical] — what's possible?"
- "Will [technology] replace [existing approach]?"

For each bucket, use web search to find real queries. Search patterns:
- `[category keyword]` — note PAA questions
- `[category] vs` — note comparison suggestions
- `best [category] for` — note use-case variants
- `how to choose [category]`
- `is [category] worth it`
- `[competitor name] vs` — note who gets compared
- `[category] companies list`

### Step 2A-2: Reddit Mining (Required)

Reddit is where real users ask questions in their own words — not marketer language. AI engines (especially ChatGPT and Perplexity) heavily crawl Reddit. This step is not optional.

Run these searches and read the actual threads:
- `site:reddit.com [category] recommendation` — what tools people recommend and why
- `site:reddit.com best [category] [current year]` — current favorites
- `site:reddit.com [category] vs` — how users compare options
- `site:reddit.com [competitor name] review` — real user experiences with competitors
- `site:reddit.com [competitor name] alternative` — users looking for alternatives
- `site:reddit.com [pain point the product solves]` — how users describe the problem

**What to extract from Reddit:**
- The exact words and phrases users type (these become GEO prompts)
- Pain points users describe that the product solves
- Which competitors get mentioned together (reveals natural comparison sets)
- Complaints about competitors (reveals differentiation angles)
- Questions that go unanswered (reveals content gaps = Easy Wins)

**Identify the 3-5 most relevant subreddits** for the category (e.g., r/sales, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, r/coldemail). These also feed into the Authority Infiltration Plan (Phase 6).

**Aim for 60-100 raw prompts before deduplication.**

### Step 2B: Map AI evaluation dimensions

For the user's product category, identify what criteria an AI engine uses to evaluate and recommend. These typically include:

- **Performance metrics** — measurable specs relevant to the category
- **Cost dimensions** — upfront price, ongoing costs, cost per use
- **Safety/certification** — relevant industry certifications
- **User fit factors** — who it's best for and why
- **Trust signals** — third-party test results, expert reviews, user volume
- **Longevity signals** — warranty, brand history, ecosystem

Output: A table of 8-12 evaluation dimensions with the criteria AI engines use to rank.

### Step 2C: Identify trusted sources

Research what sources AI engines currently cite for this category:
- Academic/research institutions
- Government regulatory bodies
- Industry associations and testing labs
- High-authority review sites
- Specific publications AI trusts for this niche
- Competitor content that gets cited

Output: List of 10-15 high-authority sources with their URLs.

### Step 2D: Score competition for each prompt

For each discovered prompt, assess:

1. **Citability** — How likely is AI to cite external sources when answering?
   - **High** = AI needs to reference specific sources (comparisons, data, recommendations)
   - **Med** = AI can answer from general knowledge but may cite
   - **Low** = AI answers from training data alone (basic definitions)

2. **Competition** — How many strong sources already answer this well?
   - **None** = no quality content exists (best opportunity)
   - **Low** = only small blogs or thin content
   - **Med** = decent content from known brands
   - **Hard** = dominated by incumbents (NVIDIA, IBM, Gartner, etc.)

Present a summary: "Found X prompts across 8 categories. Ready to build the GEO Prompt Target Table?"

---

## Phase 3: Emit prompts.csv (STRICT FORMAT)

Your final response **must be raw CSV content and nothing else**. The harness captures your final output verbatim, saves it as `prompts.csv`, and validates it against `prompts.csv.schema.md`. Any deviation fails the artifact.

### Absolute rules

1. **No prose before or after the CSV.** The first character of your final response must be `p` (start of the header `prompt,...`). The last character must be the final character of the last data row.
2. **No code fences.** Do not wrap the CSV in ` ``` ` or ` ```csv `. Just emit the CSV content.
3. **Exact header, exact order:**
   ```
   prompt,tier,citability,competition,priority,query_type,cluster,target_engines,brand_mention_mechanism,notes
   ```
4. **Exactly 10 fields per row.** Empty fields written as two adjacent commas.
5. **Quote fields containing commas, newlines, or double-quotes.** Escape embedded `"` as `""`. Most prompts contain no commas, so unquoted is usually fine.
6. **Minimum 20 data rows.** Fewer fails validation.

### Column contract

| # | Column | Type | Required | Allowed values |
|---|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | `prompt` | string | yes | full natural-language query, ≥ 5 words, unique (case-insensitive) |
| 2 | `tier` | enum | yes | `buy` \| `solve` \| `learn` |
| 3 | `citability` | enum | yes | `high` \| `medium` \| `low` |
| 4 | `competition` | enum | yes | `none` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `hard` |
| 5 | `priority` | enum | yes | `easy_win` \| `target` \| `skip` |
| 6 | `query_type` | enum | yes | `definition` \| `recommendation` \| `comparison` \| `evaluation` \| `how_to` \| `cost` \| `landscape` \| `use_case` |
| 7 | `cluster` | string | yes | non-empty, snake_case recommended |
| 8 | `target_engines` | string | yes | `\|`-separated subset of `chatgpt`, `perplexity`, `claude`, `gemini`, `ai_overview`; ≥ 1 |
| 9 | `brand_mention_mechanism` | string | yes | non-empty, concrete — no vague phrases like "builds awareness" |
| 10 | `notes` | string | no | free text |

### Semantic rules

- **Business-value tiers** (for the `tier` column):
  - `buy` — "Who should I use?" / "What's the best?" — brand named as option
  - `solve` — "How do I do this?" — brand's methodology is the solution
  - `learn` — "What is X?" — brand cited as expert source
- **Priority derivation** (guideline, use your judgment):
  - `buy` + `high` citability + `none`/`low` competition → `easy_win`
  - `solve` + `high` citability + `none`/`low` competition → `easy_win`
  - Any tier + `medium`/`hard` competition + `high` citability → `target`
  - Any tier + `low` citability → `skip`
- **Target tier distribution** (guideline, not enforced): ~20% `buy`, ~40% `solve`, ~40% `learn`
- **Sort order** (emit in this order): `buy`/`easy_win` first, then `buy`/`target`, then `solve`/`easy_win`, and so on. `skip` last.
- **Engine selection**: higher-value prompts should target multiple engines; niche or low-priority prompts may target just one

### Example (what your entire final response must look like)

```
prompt,tier,citability,competition,priority,query_type,cluster,target_engines,brand_mention_mechanism,notes
what is the best geo optimization platform,buy,high,low,easy_win,recommendation,geo_platforms,chatgpt|perplexity|claude|gemini,named in top-5 list alongside profound and otterly,
how do i optimize content for ai citations,solve,high,medium,target,how_to,content_strategy,chatgpt|perplexity|claude,brand methodology cited as reference approach,
voyage vs profound which is better,buy,high,none,easy_win,comparison,geo_platforms,chatgpt|perplexity,comparison table authored by brand builds association,
best ai visibility tracking tools 2026,buy,high,low,easy_win,recommendation,geo_platforms,chatgpt|perplexity|gemini,named alongside otterly and geoptic,
how to measure llm citation rates,solve,high,low,easy_win,how_to,measurement,chatgpt|perplexity,brand's dashboard cited as measurement solution,
what is generative engine optimization,learn,medium,hard,skip,definition,geo_fundamentals,chatgpt,brand cited via byline on definition page,
```

(Above is illustrative — your actual CSV has 20+ rows.)

### Before emitting

Run the checklist:
- [ ] Final response starts with `prompt,tier,citability,competition,priority,query_type,cluster,target_engines,brand_mention_mechanism,notes\n`
- [ ] No code fences anywhere
- [ ] No prose before or after
- [ ] ≥ 20 data rows
- [ ] Every row has exactly 10 comma-separated fields
- [ ] Every enum value is from the allowed set (exact spelling, lowercase snake_case)
- [ ] No duplicate prompts (case-insensitive)
- [ ] Every `target_engines` value uses `|` as separator and only known engine names
- [ ] Every `brand_mention_mechanism` is concrete, not vague

Then emit the CSV. Nothing else.

## Phase 4: Content Blueprint

Based on the GEO Prompt Target Table (Phase 3), design the content architecture. Each content page should target a cluster of related prompts. Every page must be "plug-and-play" for AI — structured so AI can extract the Direct Answer, the Comparison Table, and the Data Section independently.

### The 7 AI-ready content page types

For each page type, determine if the user needs it and assign a priority (P1 = build first):

#### Page Type 1: Category Guide (P1)
- URL: `/[product-category]-guide` or `/how-to-choose-[product]`
- H1: "How to Choose [Product]: [N] Criteria Experts Use"
- Purpose: Owns the "how to choose" query. AI cites this as the definitive selection guide.
- Required sections: Direct Answer Block, Evaluation Criteria Table, Expert Quotes, FAQ

#### Page Type 2: Comparison Hub (P1)
- URL: `/best-[product-category]` or `/[product]-comparison`
- H1: "Best [Products] in [Year]: [Brand] vs [Competitor 1] vs [Competitor 2] Compared"
- Purpose: Owns "best X" queries. AI uses comparison tables to answer "which is better" questions.
- Required sections: Top Pick Summary, Full Comparison Table (8+ criteria), Individual Reviews, FAQ
- For the comparison table, consider using the **create-geo-charts** skill to render a visual comparison bar chart alongside the HTML table — this gives AI engines two extractable formats

#### Page Type 3: Data & Evidence Page (P1)
- URL: `/[product]-test-results` or `/[product]-performance-data`
- H1: "[Product] Independent Test Results: [Key Metric] Performance"
- Purpose: Provides verifiable data AI can cite as evidence. Must contain real test data, not marketing claims.
- Required sections: Test methodology, Data tables with numbers, Third-party verification, Charts
- Use the **create-geo-charts** skill for all charts on this page — each chart needs the full GEO text layer (action title, key finding summary, HTML data table, CSV download, Dataset JSON-LD)

#### Page Type 4: Use Case Pages (P2)
- One page per major use case identified in Phase 2
- URL: `/[product]-for-[use-case]` (e.g., `/water-purifier-for-apartments`)
- Purpose: Owns "X for [specific situation]" queries
- Required sections: Direct Answer for this use case, Why this matters, Recommended options for this context, FAQ

#### Page Type 5: Myth-Busting / FAQ Page (P2)
- URL: `/[product]-questions-answered` or `/[product]-myths`
- H1: "Is [Product] Worth It? Your Top Questions Answered with Data"
- Purpose: Captures doubt/trust queries. Shows up when users are close to buying but need reassurance.
- Required sections: Direct answer to the "worth it" question, Data-backed answers to each objection, Real user scenarios

#### Page Type 6: Glossary / Technical Reference (P3)
- URL: `/[product]-glossary` or `/[product]-technical-guide`
- Purpose: Becomes the authoritative definition source AI cites when explaining terminology
- Required sections: Term definitions with measurements, Standards references, How terms relate to product choice

#### Page Type 7: Brand Story / About Page (P3)
- Purpose: Establishes who made this, why, and what qualifies them
- Required sections: Founder/team expertise, Testing methodology, Data sources used, Contact/verification info

### Blueprint output format

Present a prioritized table:

| Priority | Page Type | Suggested URL | Target Query | Why AI Will Cite It |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Category Guide | /how-to-choose-[X] | "how to choose [X]" | Covers all evaluation criteria in one place |
| P1 | Comparison Hub | /best-[X] | "best [X] 2025" | Has structured comparison table AI can extract |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Ask: "Which pages do you want to build first? I'll write them one at a time in Phase 5."

---

## Phase 5: Content Generation

Generate content one page at a time. For each page:

1. Ask the user for any specific data, test results, or claims they want included
2. Do web research to find real statistics and authoritative sources for this page
3. Write the full page content
4. Include a structured data JSON-LD block for the page
5. Ask if the user wants changes before moving to the next page

### Content template: every page must have these zones

#### Zone 1: Direct Answer Block (40-60 words)
The most important zone. AI extracts this verbatim to answer user questions.

```
## [Question format H2 — match exact user query]

[Product category] [does X] by [mechanism]. [Key differentiator of this product].
[Primary outcome for the buyer]. [One concrete measurement or fact].
```

Rules:
- Under 60 words
- Contains at least 1 specific number or measurement
- No pronouns referring to prior context — must stand alone
- Answers the H2 question directly in sentence 1

#### Zone 2: Comparison Table
AI extracts comparison tables to answer "which is better" and "X vs Y" questions.

Format:
```
| Criteria | [Your Product] | [Competitor 1] | [Competitor 2] |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Metric 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
| [Metric 2] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
```

Rules:
- Minimum 5 criteria, maximum 10
- All values must be verifiable — link to sources
- Include criteria where your product wins AND criteria where it doesn't — AI trusts balanced content
- Last row: Overall verdict with plain language recommendation

#### Zone 3: Data & Evidence Section
AI cites pages with verifiable data. Every claim needs a source.

Format for each data point:
```
[Specific claim with number]. According to [Source Name], [supporting context] ([year]).
```

Rules:
- Minimum 5 data points per page
- Every number linked to primary source
- Include third-party test data where available (certification bodies, labs, consumer organizations)
- Date every claim — freshness matters to AI

#### Zone 4: Scenario Solutions
AI answers "X for [situation]" by citing pages that address specific scenarios.

Format per scenario:
```
### For [Specific User Type]
**The problem**: [Specific situation they face]
**What matters most**: [2-3 criteria that matter for this scenario]
**Recommended approach**: [Specific guidance]
**Why**: [Evidence or reasoning with source]
```

Minimum 3 scenarios per page, matched to the use case questions from Phase 2.

#### Zone 5: FAQ Section
Format each Q&A to be extractable as a standalone answer:

```
### [Exact question users ask — match People Also Ask phrasing]
[Direct answer in 1-2 sentences]. [Supporting detail]. [Source if applicable].
```

Rules:
- 6-8 questions per page
- Each answer complete on its own — no "as mentioned above"
- Include at least 1 pricing/cost question, 1 comparison question, 1 how-to question
- Add FAQPage JSON-LD schema

### Structured data for every page

After writing each page, generate the appropriate JSON-LD:

**For product/comparison pages** — Product + Review + Comparison composite:
```json
{
  "[аккаунт]": "https://schema.org",
  "[аккаунт]": ["Product", "ItemList"],
  "name": "[Page Title]",
  "description": "[Direct Answer Block text]",
  "review": {
    "[аккаунт]": "Review",
    "reviewRating": { "[аккаунт]": "Rating", "ratingValue": "X", "bestRating": "5" },
    "author": { "[аккаунт]": "Organization", "name": "[Brand]" }
  }
}
```

**For FAQ sections** — FAQPage:
```json
{
  "[аккаунт]": "https://schema.org",
  "[аккаунт]": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "[аккаунт]": "Question",
      "name": "[Q1]",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "[аккаунт]": "Answer", "text": "[A1]" }
    }
  ]
}
```

**For how-to pages** — HowTo:
```json
{
  "[аккаунт]": "https://schema.org",
  "[аккаунт]": "HowTo",
  "name": "[Title]",
  "step": [
    { "[аккаунт]": "HowToStep", "name": "[Step Name]", "text": "[Step Description]" }
  ]
}
```

**For data/claims pages** — ClaimReview (for each key claim):
```json
{
  "[аккаунт]": "https://schema.org",
  "[аккаунт]": "ClaimReview",
  "claimReviewed": "[Exact claim text]",
  "author": { "[аккаунт]": "Organization", "name": "[Brand]" },
  "reviewRating": {
    "[аккаунт]": "Rating",
    "alternateName": "True",
    "ratingValue": "1",
    "bestRating": "1",
    "worstRating": "-1"
  },
  "url": "[Source URL]"
}
```

Generate content for each priority page. After each page ask: "Page complete. Want to edit anything, or should I move to the next page?"

---

## Phase 6: Authority Infiltration Plan

The last phase. After content exists on the website, build the off-site signals that make AI engines trust your site as a primary source.

AI engines don't trust isolated websites. They trust sources that are cited by other trusted sources. The goal: get your content referenced on platforms AI regularly crawls.

### For each platform, generate a specific action plan

#### Quora (High Priority — ChatGPT crawls Quora heavily)
- Search for existing questions in your category
- Write 3-5 answers to high-view questions where your data page is a credible source
- Format: Answer fully first (don't require clicking the link), then: "I documented the full test methodology and data at [URL] if you want the primary source."
- Include your specific statistics in the answer body

Action output: List 5 specific Quora questions to answer, with a draft answer outline for each.

#### Reddit (High Priority — AI crawls subreddit discussions)
- Identify the 3-5 most relevant subreddits for the category
- Strategy: Post data-only content (no promotion), establish expertise, website in profile only
- Format: "I ran [test/comparison] for [N] months. Here's what I found: [data table]. Happy to share more."
- Never post links in the post itself — only in profile bio

Action output: List target subreddits, draft 2 post concepts with data-first framing.

#### Medium (Medium Priority — AI cites Medium thought leadership)
- Write 1 deep analysis article: "[Category] Industry Analysis: What the Data Actually Shows"
- Include your comparison tables, cite primary sources (including your own data pages)
- Tag correctly for the category topic
- Link to your data pages as the primary source

Action output: Medium article outline with suggested title and section structure.

#### Wikipedia (Selective — only if you have genuinely novel data)
- Find the Wikipedia article for the product category
- Identify if your test data page qualifies as a reference (must be genuinely informative, not promotional)
- If yes: add to References or External Links section only if the data is unique and verifiable
- If no: do not touch Wikipedia — it will be removed and flagged

Action output: Identify the relevant Wikipedia article, assess if your content qualifies, and specify exactly which section and format.

#### Industry Forums / Niche Communities
- Identify 3-5 industry-specific forums or communities (home improvement forums, specialty retailer communities, trade association sites)
- Strategy: Become the data expert. Answer technical questions with your data.
- Profile bio or signature: website URL only

Action output: List target communities with discovery search queries to find them.

### Flywheel effect

Explain to the user: Once one AI engine cites your content, the snowball starts:
1. ChatGPT recommendation → user screenshots and posts to Reddit
2. Reddit discussion → Claude crawls and cites the thread
3. Claude citation → Perplexity references Claude's sources
4. Perplexity listing → more websites cite Perplexity's recommendations
5. Your brand appears in every AI engine's training context

This is why content quality compounds: being cited once leads to being cited everywhere.

---

## Verification: Test Your GEO Standing

After all phases are complete, tell the user how to test their current AI visibility:

### Manual AI testing protocol
Ask these exact queries in ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity:

1. "What is the best [product category] right now?"
2. "How do I choose a [product]?"
3. "Is [your brand name] a good [product]?"
4. "What are the pros and cons of [your product name]?"
5. "[Your product] vs [top competitor] — which is better?"

Record: Does your brand appear? Which pages are cited? What is said?

### What good looks like
- Brand mentioned in response body (not just a cited link) = high GEO visibility
- Your data page cited as a source = content is trusted
- Your comparison table content quoted = structured data is working
- FAQ answer extracted verbatim = snippet optimization is working

### What to do if not appearing
- Check that AI bots are not blocked in robots.txt (run aeo-audit.sh if available)
- Verify structured data is valid (use Google Rich Results Test)
- Confirm content has been published for at least 2-4 weeks (indexing lag)
- Check if your data pages have fewer than 250 words — they need substantive content
- Re-run Phase 2 to identify if you're targeting the right query types
