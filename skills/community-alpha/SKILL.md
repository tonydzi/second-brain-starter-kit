  Run ONE full community-alpha pass over an imported community-chat corpus — deterministic
  detector (0 tokens) → LLM judge → harvest → review screen. Trigger on "/community-alpha
  <source> [month]", "mine alpha from <community>". Built for any imported chat corpus with a
  per-source config; safe to re-run (idempotent by message id).

# /community-alpha <source> [month] — one community-alpha run

Example: `/community-alpha sostav 2026-06`. No month given → the previous full month.

## Steps

1. **Is there a detector?** `$IMPORTS_ROOT/<source>\<source>_alpha.py` (today: `lobster`, `sostav`).
   - No → this is a NEW corpus: offer the operator a one-off adapter built to the existing pattern (schema from their SQLite + language keys + intro/banter penalty + topic weights; template = `sostav_alpha.py`). Do not build it without an explicit "+".
2. **Run the detector** (0 tokens):
   ```
   cd /e/Obsidian/_imports/<source> && PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python <source>_alpha.py \
     --since <YYYY-MM-01> --until <the 1st of the next month> --top 35 --tag <YYYY-MM>
   ```
   → `$IMPORTS_ROOT/alpha/candidates/<source>-<tag>-report.md`. Show the scanned→shortlisted counter.
3. **Judge** (me, with the session model): I read ONLY the report (~35 candidates, never the corpus — token economy) and give a verdict ✅ ALPHA / 🟡 WATCH / 🗑 NOISE with a reason for each → write `$IMPORTS_ROOT/alpha/candidates/<source>-judged-latest.md` (format: `## ✅ ALPHA` / `## 🟡 WATCH` / `## 🗑 NOISE (DROP)`, inside it `### #N — title` + Verdict + Reason — the harvest parser already understands this).
4. **Is the miner registered?** `MINERS` in `$IMPORTS_ROOT/alpha/alpha_harvest.py`. No → add the row `("<source>", "<source>-judged-latest.md", "<home-note>")`. ⚠️ A parallel fleet edits this file too — re-read it immediately before editing (verify-existing), and keep the edit strictly additive. Optional: a label in the server's `MINER_LABEL`/`ORDER` (it does not crash without one — there is a fallback).
5. **Harvest + screen**: `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/alpha/alpha_harvest.py` (counters!) → `/alpha-review`. The new batch is visible by the 🆕 badge.

## Boundaries
- 🔒 Private communities (sostav and the like) are HIGH sensitivity: the layer stays strictly local, nothing goes outside; people surfaced by a find are approached value-first / warm intro only (zero cold DMs). Risk signals are DATA, not "opportunities".
- Judge honestly: reference cards, intro blurbs and restatements are 🗑 — never stretch a ✅ to pad the counter.
- This skill writes nothing into the vault; moving gold into home notes is a separate step behind the Tier-2 gate (the "→ to home" queue on the screen).
