# /rr — alias for /retro

**What it is:** just a short hotkey. `/rr` = `/retro`, letter-for-letter the same thing.
Typing `rr` is faster than `retro`. There is NO separate logic here and there must never be any.

**What to do on trigger:** immediately invoke the `retro` skill via the Skill tool and follow it as usual.
Do not copy the retro steps here — the single source is the `retro` skill (the "one source, no duplicates" rule; simplicity-first).

**The double-letter alias family** (one logic per pair):
- `/tt` == `/test` — test what was just built
- `/rr` == `/retro` — end-of-session retrospective
- `/cc` — print a ready-made `/compact` line for this session
- `/1` == `/!` — resurrect after a crash

**Boundaries:** the folder name is `rr`, so `/rr` works natively; wrong-keyboard-layout variants are
text triggers — on recognizing them, run this same skill. Case-insensitive ([[commands-case-insensitive]]).
