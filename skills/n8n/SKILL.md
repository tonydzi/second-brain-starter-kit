# /n8n — automation-stack health & repair

> 🧒 When reporting to Anton end with a child-simple "Простыми словами" recap. (memory `eli5-always`)

Anton's operational nervous system = self-hosted **n8n at `https://n8n.example.com`** (v2.14.2, 89 workflows). n8n = event bus, NOT the brain. Full state + every gotcha = memory [[n8n-stack]] (read it first). Workflows fail SILENTLY → this skill makes failure visible and fixes it safely.

**Access:** REST `https://n8n.example.com/api/v1/`, header `X-N8N-API-KEY`; key in `$USERPROFILE/.claude/secrets/n8n.env` ⚠️ **expires 2026-07-15** (recreate non-expiring; warn if near). API needs a browser **User-Agent** header or returns 403 (WAF). The **n8n MCP** (`mcp__n8n__*`) is wired BUT can drop mid-session (it disconnected 2026-07-04) — do NOT depend on it.

**MCP-down fallback = build/edit straight over REST (proven 2026-07-04):** `$IMPORTS_ROOT/n8n\n8n_build.py` — `create_workflow(name,nodes,connections)`, `post_webhook(path,payload)` (fire a webhook for /tt), `set_active(id,on)`; and `n8n_edit.py` — `get_workflow/update_workflow` (backup-before-PUT), `list_workflows`, `_req`. Both reuse the WAF User-Agent. The resilience workflows built this way — **WATCHDOG** `IdSRNxfOT9Mo7Qse` (dead-man's-switch), **ERROR CATCHER** `5X7xsGlwz44AO8Wf` (set as `settings.errorWorkflow` to make a workflow's failures scream in chat 03), **INBOUND DOOR** `5e8JGjnVSvnkrRSX`, **bus-bridge** `U96y7qLDLufGpbUf` — plus their builders (`watchdog_build.py`/`catcher_build.py`/`inbound_build.py`) live in `_imports\n8n\`. Full map = memory [[n8n-watchdog]].

## Step 0 — key liveness (run BEFORE anything else)
First check the API key is still alive: compare today's date to `N8N_KEY_EXPIRES` in `n8n.env` (see **Access** above for the date). If today is **past** it the key is DEAD → every call silently 403s, so recreate the key first (n8n UI → Settings → API → new key, paste into `n8n.env`, bump `N8N_KEY_EXPIRES`) — a Tier-2 write, so pause for Anton's **"+"** (see **Safety**). Within ~7 days → warn but proceed.

## Modes

- **`health` (default, READ-ONLY)** — `mcp__n8n__n8n_health_check` for liveness, then scan recent executions for errors (`mcp__n8n__n8n_executions` status=error, or `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/n8n/fetch_n8n.py`). Report RED (persistent code-level failures), FLAKY (transient 503/aborted → just enable node auto-retry), and IDLE-but-active (cron not firing). **ALWAYS prove a failure from a real execution** (`resultData.runData[node].error`) before naming a cause — the failing node may differ from the first suspect.
- **`dashboard`** — `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/n8n/build_dashboard.py` → open `_Dashboards\n8n-Automation-Audit.html` (Anton works by eye). Re-run `fetch_n8n.py` → `enrich_n8n.py` → `build_dashboard.py` to refresh (all 0 LLM tokens; cluster summaries on FREE Sonnet subagents per [[model-routing-sonnet-grunt]]).
- **`fix <id>`** — repair ONE workflow. **BACKUP FIRST always:** `python $IMPORTS_ROOT/n8n/n8n_edit.py backup-all` (→ `raw/backup_<ts>/`; per-edit before/after to `raw/edits/`, restore via `restore_workflow`). Show Anton the diff (ДО→ПОСЛЕ), get his **"+"**, then apply. PUT needs ONLY {name,nodes,connections,settings} (strip read-only fields).

## Known scars (verify still true before acting — memory may be stale)
- **Events Posting** — was `name '_input' is not defined` (Python task-runner bug); FIXED 2026-06-16 by converting Code nodes Python→JavaScript. **Rule: when a Python code node mysteriously fails on `_input`, convert to JS** rather than debugging Pyodide.
- **Gitbook Pavel** — was 11% err on empty-sessionId; FIXED with an additive guard Filter before the memory chain.
- **Codex cron / aaaZeroInbound** — abandoned/standalone (awaiting Anton's archive call).

## Safety
- Health = read-only, run freely. Editing/activating a workflow, recreating the API key, deleting workflows = pause + confirm (Tier-2, [[operating-agreement]]).
- Backup BEFORE every edit (`backup-all`); never edit without the snapshot.

## Output
RED/FLAKY/IDLE counts + the worst offender with its proven error + suggested fix. Then 🧒 recap. Related: [[platinum-crm-import]] (CHARM CRM engine), [[automation-inventory]] (that = LOCAL jobs; this = REMOTE n8n).
