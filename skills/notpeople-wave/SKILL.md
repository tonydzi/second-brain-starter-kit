# /notpeople-wave — next NotPeople investor outreach wave

> 🧒 **When reporting to the operator** (status/summaries — NEVER inside the pitches themselves): end with a child-simple "In plain words" recap in their language. Standing request, memory `eli5-always`.

> 📖 **Operates under `telegram-lead-outreach`** (the general Telegram outreach playbook) and the `bible` outreach domain. This skill only adds the NotPeople-specific sequencing + the dedup-ledger discipline. Don't duplicate guardrails — they live there; newer rule beats older.

**What this is.** NotPeople = a $600K pre-seed SAFE raise pitched to ranked crypto/VC investors over Telegram from **@work_acct_a**. Nina is the live lead operator; this (follower) machine runs the sends. Project memory: `notpeople-outreach-waves`. Pipeline lives in `$IMPORTS_ROOT\notpeople\` (on the hub: `$IMPORTS_ROOT/notpeople/` — drive-agnostic scripts).

**The two bugs this skill exists to prevent (25 Jun 2026):**
1. The 22 Jun wave was **never appended to `NotPeople-Pitched.csv`**, so `select_next_investors.py` kept proposing already-pitched leads.
2. Sending blind from the ranked queue → duplicate sends, a wrong name (draft "Mei" → actually Alex), and dead handles.
The fix is baked into steps 2 and 5 below: **read each lead's live thread before sending**, and **append the wave the moment it's sent**.

## The wave checklist

### 0. RECALL (cheap, first)
- Read memory `notpeople-outreach-waves` (pipeline + the gotcha) and `leads-live-operator-check-thread`.
- Confirm which machine you're on. **Follower (Nina, vault on D:, receive-only):** local CSV/dashboard edits may be reverted by Syncthing → you MUST also relay the pitched-record to the hub (step 6). **Hub (`HUB-1`):** you are the source of truth, no relay needed.

### 1. Select the next N truly-new investors
- Default N = 10 (operator may say a number). The operator may name leads to **skip** (e.g. "skip Karim") → drop them, pull the next-ranked to refill N.
- Run the selector: `python "$IMPORTS_ROOT\notpeople\select_next_investors.py"` (reads the scored pool, excludes anyone already in `NotPeople-Pitched.csv`).
- ⚠️ **The ranked queue is contaminated** — its top was already pitched 22 Jun. Do NOT trust queue position alone. Treat the selector output as *candidates*, then verify each in step 2. If the top is all already-contacted, scan deeper (positions 23+ were clean on 25 Jun).

### 2. Verify EACH candidate against the live thread (the rule that saved us)
For every candidate, before composing anything:
- `resolve_username(@handle, account="work_acct_a")` → **GEN-ERR-659 = dead/changed handle → drop it**, refill from next-ranked.
- `get_history(<chat>, account="work_acct_a", limit=…)` → read the actual thread.
  - Already pitched / mid-conversation → **drop** (it's a duplicate; if it was pitched but not in the CSV, note it for the backfill in step 5).
  - Name mismatch between the draft and the real Telegram display name → **fix the name** (the "Mei"→"Alex" bug).
  - Clean / no prior contact → keep.
- Assemble the final N truly-new, name-correct leads. **Report the list to the operator and WAIT for "+"** before sending (outbound = Tier-2, ask-first).

### 3. Compose + send (Opus voice, per lead) — only after "+"
- Pitches come from `build_pitch_drafts.py` (50 personalized, ranked) — `python "$IMPORTS_ROOT\notpeople\build_pitch_drafts.py"` writes `pitch_queue.json` + a drafts note. Top-N = the batch. Personalize per lead; **@work_acct_a = the operator's personal voice → Opus**, no copy-paste blast, pace the sends ([[telegram-lead-outreach]] guardrails).
- The standing pitch BODY (NotPeople, $600K pre-seed SAFE, Calendly close) lives in `build_pitch_drafts.py` — reuse it, don't rewrite the offer.
- `send_message(<chat>, <text>, account="work_acct_a")` per lead.

### 4. Verify delivery per-lead (don't assume)
- After the batch, `get_history(<chat>, account="work_acct_a", limit=1)` for each → confirm the outbound msg landed (capture msg_id + timestamp). Report "N/N delivered" with the ids. This is the "are you sure it actually went out?" check — do it without being asked.

### 5. Record the wave IMMEDIATELY (the dedup ledger — never skip)
- Append every sent lead to `NotPeople-Pitched.csv` (in `_Dashboards`), columns `Lead name,Username,Company`.
- **Also backfill** any lead you found in step 2 that was clearly pitched earlier but missing from the CSV (this is exactly the 22 Jun gap). The CSV is the single dedup source `select_next_investors.py` reads — if it's stale, the next wave re-pitches people.

### 6. Refresh the tracker snapshot + (follower only) relay to hub
- Edit the inline wave list in `build_notpeople_tracker.py` (new wave kept as its OWN section, OUT of the waves-1+2 funnel, so reply-rate stays honest), then `python "$IMPORTS_ROOT/notpeople/build_notpeople_tracker.py"` (hub `E:`; follower `D:`). This rewrites `tg_followups_notpeople.json` + `tg_assistant_log_notpeople.jsonl` — the tracker schema the outreach/pipeline dashboard reads.
- Open the outreach view for the operator with a **cache-bust** query so a stale browser tab doesn't hide the update: `_Dashboards\NotPeople-Outreach-Dashboard.html?v=<ts>` (static snapshot — hand-edit its wave section if you need it visually current).
- **Follower machine:** relay the pitched-record to the hub so the real dedup lands there too: `python "%USERPROFILE%\.claude\scripts\machine_bus.py" send HUB-1 "NotPeople wave <date>: appended N rows to Pitched.csv (<handles>); prune dead handles <…> from pool."`

### 7. Report (tight, ELI5 at the end)
Operator-facing: N sent + N/N delivered (with ids), N dropped (dups/dead handles), CSV +rows, dashboard refreshed, hub relay sent. Then the 🧒 recap.

## Guardrails (inherited, not re-implemented)
- Outbound = **Tier-2 / ask-first**: assemble + report the batch, send only on the operator's "+". NO mass auto-blast; pace the sends. (money/commitments/secrets → pause + ask — [[telegram-lead-outreach]], [[telegram-assistant]].)
- **HUB never messages leads** — leads are worked by the live operator (Nina). On the hub, this skill prepares/records but does not send. ([[leads-live-operator-check-thread]].)
- No em/en dashes anywhere (memory `no-long-dashes`).

## Files & values (reuse, don't recreate)
- Send account: `@work_acct_a` (work_acct_a, Tony SF / Bay Area).
- Pipeline: `$IMPORTS_ROOT/notpeople/` (hub `E:`; follower `D:`) — `select_next_investors.py`, `build_pitch_drafts.py`, `build_notpeople_tracker.py` (snapshots wave state into the tracker JSON the dashboard reads; drive-agnostic).
- Dedup ledger: `_Dashboards\NotPeople-Pitched.csv`. Dashboard: `_Dashboards\NotPeople-Outreach-Dashboard.html`.
- Offer: $600K pre-seed SAFE · deck `notpeople.ai/pitch` · Calendly `https://calendly.com/paloaltolab/1-on-1`.
- GEN-ERR-659 = dead/changed handle. machine_bus relay target = `HUB-1`.
